# .NET Extension Library for VRChat

This directory (namespace: `Mochizuki.VRChat.Extensions`) includes extension classes for VRChat SDK classes.  
These classes are used by Mochizuki (ねこのや) products and others.  
Some non-extension classes are now included for convenience (namespace: `Mochizuki.VRChat.Extensions.Convenience`).

## Why create/use this library?

The VRCSDK is not intended for code-based development, like most SDKs, but rather is based on Unity's GUI.  
As a result, some operations are inconvenient to perform from the codebase.  
To alleviate those problems, this library of extended classes exists.

## Requirements

This class library is based on VRCSDK3-AVATAR.

- .NET Framework 4.5 Compatible or .NET Standard 2.1
- VRCSDK3-AVATAR 2020.08.06.16.30

## Version

See `Mochizuki.VRChat.Extensions.Constants#Version` property.
